# How to Build

Building Sourcetrail requires several dependencies to be in place on your machine. However, our CMake based setup allows to disable indexing support for specific languages which reduces the number of dependencies to a minimum.

## Building the bare minimum

### Required Tools

#### Git

This is required for generating the Sourcetrail version number. Get it from: https://git-scm.com/download.

Make sure `git` is available in added to your `PATH` environment variable.

#### CMake v3.12

This is used for generating a build configuration. Get it from: https://cmake.org/download/

### Additional tools for Windows

#### Visual Studio

### Additional tools for Unix

#### ccache

This is optionally used to speed up rebuilds if found in `PATH`.

### Required dependencies

#### Boost 1.67
For the __msvc__ compiler pre-built binaries can be downloaded from [sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/)

For building on Unix:
```
$ ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=filesystem,program_options,system,date_time
$ ./b2 --link=static --variant=release --threading=multi --runtime-link=static --cxxflags=-fPIC
```

#### Qt 5.12

__Note__: still causes style issues on Windows, resort to Qt 5.10

For the __msvc__ compiler pre-built binaries can be downloaded from [download.qt.io/official_releases/qt](http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/)

### Building

#### For Windows / Visual Studio
```
$ cd Sourcetrail
$ mkdir -p build/win64
$ cd build/win64
$ cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DBOOST_ROOT=<path/to/boost_1_68_0> -DQt5_DIR=<path/to/Qt/version/platform/compiler/lib/cmake/Qt5> ../..
```
If you are using the gui, we recommend that you activate advanced mode. Also you may be required to add some of the defines via the "Add Entry" button.

After generating the build configuration, just open the Sourcetrail.sln file that was generated by CMake and build the Sourcetrail project.

##### If using clang-cl.exe and Ninja (such as via CLion)

Here's what I ended up using for Clang/Ninja builds via CLion:

* [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019](https://aka.ms/buildtools) (as an alternative to installing Visual Studio)
* [Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/) for released versions of Windows. If running a Windows Insider preview, you'll need the [Preview SDK](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/for-developers/) instead.
* Boost 1.72.0 compiled [following Windows instructions](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/more/getting_started/windows.html) from within [a Build Tools command prompt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=vs-2019#developer_command_file_locations) (or you can download a [pre-compiled set of binaries](https://bintray.com/boostorg/release/boost-binaries)).
* Qt 5.15 Beta for official VS 2019 support (download the standard [Qt Community installer](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source) and then [install Qt 5.15 from the Preview package category](https://www.qt.io/blog/2019/04/11/updated-qt-installer-released).)
* Clang v10 compiler binaries for Windows (on the [LLVM Download page](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html) , install **Windows (64-bit)** under **Pre-Built Binaries**)
* [CMake 3.17.0](https://cmake.org/download/) for Windows x64 (from installer .msi)
* Clang source code (follow the instructions under **Enable C/C++ Language Support** though in my case I had success compiling via CLion with out-of-the-box settings)
* [Ninja for Windows](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases) extracted somewhere (in my case C:\Ninja\ninja.exe)
* [CLion EAP](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/nextversion/) (optional, but makes running CMake builds with different compilers really easy...)

Configure CLion as follows:

From **Settings** in the **File** menu, click **Toolchains** under **Build, Execution, Deployment** on the left.

Then click the **+** button to create a new Toolchain, as follows:

| Toolchain Field | Value                                                            |
|:----------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name            | CN (or something equally short)                                  |
| Environment     | `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\BuildTools` |
| Architecture    | amd64                                                            |
| CMake           | `C:\Program Files\CMake\bin\cmake.exe`                           |
| Make            | `C:\Ninja\ninja.exe`                                             |
| C Compiler      | `C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin\clang-cl.exe`                         |
| C++ Compiler    | `C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin\clang-cl.exe`                         |

Then adjust project-specific **CMake** settings by clicking **CMake** below **Toolchains** on the left.

Make sure to select the **Toolchain** you created above in **CMake** settings. You can click the **+** button to add more CMake build folders, each can have a different set of Release/Debug compile options.

Note: Your **Build type** must match the same build type you may have used previously for your dependencies (Clang, Boost) or you may have build errors when linking to them.

The following **CMake options** were useful in compiling with the above:

```
-G
Ninja
-DBoost_DEBUG=ON
-DBOOST_INCLUDEDIR=C:\local\boost_1_72_0
-DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR=C:\local\boost_1_72_0\stage\x64\lib
-DBOOST_LIB_TOOLSET=vc142
-DBoost_COMPILER=-vc142
-DQt5_DIR=C:\Qt\5.15.0\msvc2019_64\lib\cmake\Qt5
-DLLVM_DIR=C:\llvm-project\llvm\build\lib\cmake\llvm
-DClang_DIR=C:\llvm-project\llvm\build\lib\cmake\clang
-DBUILD_CXX_LANGUAGE_PACKAGE=ON
```

Adjust paths as necessary.
* **-G Ninja** tells CMake to use Ninja for the build. 
* **-DBoost_DEBUG** helps with troubleshoot finding Boost when you generate a CMake build.
* **-DBOOST_INCLUDEDIR** tells CMake where to find your Boost header files
* **-DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR** tells CMake where to find your precompiled Boost libs
* **-DBOOST_LIB_TOOLSET** is a custom CMake variable, it passes through to Boost's autolinker what compiler to expect in the lib file name, if different from the current compiler. (In this case, Boost was compiled with MSVC from VS 2019 but as we're compiling here with Clang, Boost tries to link against a file with clangw10 in its name.)
* **-DBoost_COMPILER** like above, is used by CMake to build filenames for required pre-compiled lib binaries for Boost.
* **-DQt5_DIR** should be set to Qt5 cmake files, in this case Qt 5.15 files for MSVC 2019 x64 environments.
* **-DLLVM_DIR** and **-DClang_DIR** and **-DBUILD_CXX_LANGUAGE_PACKAGE** For these, see the **Enable C/C++ Language Support** section later in this file.

If using **Java** you might want to fill in the **Environment** box in **CMake** settings with JAVA_HOME, M2_HOME and MAVEN_HOME.

#### For Unix

```
$ cd Sourcetrail
$ mkdir -p build/Release
$ cd build/Release
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" -DBOOST_ROOT=<path/to/boost_1_68_0> -DQt5_DIR=<path/to/Qt/version/platform/compiler/lib/cmake/Qt5> ../..
$ make Sourcetrail
```

### Running

Run Sourcetrail from within the build directory. During execution Sourcetrail needs resources from `bin/app/data` and `bin/app/user`. Cmake creates symlinks to these directories within the build directory.


## Enable C/C++ Language Support

### Required dependencies

#### LLVM/Clang 10.0.0

##### Windows
For the __msvc__ compiler, follow [these steps](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html) to build the project. Make sure to check out the correct tag (`git checkout llvmorg-10.0.0`) and run the cmake command exactly as described.

###### Building

Run CMake with these additional options:
```
-DLLVM_DIR=C:\llvm-project\llvm\build\lib\cmake\llvm
-DClang_DIR=C:\llvm-project\llvm\build\lib\cmake\clang
-DBUILD_CXX_LANGUAGE_PACKAGE=ON
```

##### Unix
For Unix, follow this [installation guide](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibASTMatchersTutorial.html)

Build with `-DLLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=ON`.

###### Building

Run CMake with these additional options:
```
-DClang_DIR=<path/to/llvm_build/lib/cmake/clang>
-DBUILD_CXX_LANGUAGE_PACKAGE=ON
```

## Enable Java Language Support

### Required dependencies
